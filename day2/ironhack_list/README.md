# IronhackLIST

You will now implement a Ironhack directory of students, that shows a list of everyone’s name, surname, birthday, a clickable link to their website, if they have programming experience or not (Yes/No) and, more importantly, ¡the number of dogs they have!

Apart from that, you should be able to create new students through the interface, and also delete the ones which have 0 dogs (we cannot
kick the others out, they have dogs!).
