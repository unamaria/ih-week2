# The Sinatra TODO

In the good old days, programming a basic blog was the "Hello World!" for the web. Now it seems to be writing a TODO list,
as if we wanted to overthrone Evernote for that. So let's be hipsters about it, and do the job!

Let's use Sinatra for that! Write a small application that allows us to:

* Add tasks to a list
* We should be able to mark a task as done
* Once done we should be able to delete a task
* The date of creation should be shown together with the task
* If the task contains the word urgent the task will become the most prioritary
