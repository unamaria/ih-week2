# The online calculator

## Iteration 1: Create the basic Calculator

Our basic Online Calculator should have a home page (‘/‘) where you see all four available operations: add, subtract, multiply and divide. Pretty simple stuff.

For each one of the available operations, we will have a form with two input fields and a button, which will go to another URL/route and display the result, like “The multiplication of 4 and 15 is 60” or “The addition of 10 and 39 is 49".

## Iteration 2: Only one form

Real calculators doesn't have input fields for each operation. Having a single form with two input fields and four buttons, one for each operation, would be closer to reality. 

## Iteration 3: Add a memory feature

Add two buttons: the first one will store the result so the user can operate from it in an external file and the second one will give the user to erase the memory.
